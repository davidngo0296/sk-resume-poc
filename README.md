## üèóÔ∏è Clean Architecture

### Generic vs Task-Specific Components

The system follows a **clean separation** between generic infrastructure and task-specific logic:

#### **Generic Components** (`main.py`)
- **`MultiAgentCLI`**: Generic command-line interface that works with any workflow
- **UI Management**: Menu, panels, and interaction handling
- **Conversation Management**: Save, load, pause, resume functionality
- **Session Orchestration**: Starting/stopping agent sessions

#### **Task-Specific Components** (`script_group_chat_manager.py`)
- **Workflow Configuration**: Agent roles, approval rules, sequences
- **UI Customization**: Colors, text, prompts specific to video scripts
- **Completion Detection**: Logic to determine when video script workflow is done
- **Delegation Intelligence**: Smart routing based on video script context

#### **Creating New Workflows**
To create a different workflow (e.g., blog writing, code review):

1. **Create new workflow manager**:
```python
class BlogGroupChatManager(MultiAgentGroupChatManager):
    def _setup_blog_workflow(self):
        # Configure for blog writing
    
    def get_workflow_display_info(self):
        # Blog-specific UI text
    
    def is_workflow_complete(self):
        # Blog-specific completion logic
```

2. **Update one line in main.py**:
```python
# Change this line:
self.workflow_manager = ScriptGroupChatManager(manager_agent, specialist_agents)
# To this:
self.workflow_manager = BlogGroupChatManager(manager_agent, specialist_agents)
```

3. **Done!** The entire UI automatically adapts to the new workflow.

### Benefits of This Architecture
- **Reusability**: `main.py` works with any workflow type
- **Maintainability**: Task logic is isolated in workflow managers
- **Extensibility**: Easy to create new workflow types
- **Testability**: Components can be tested independently

## üîß Configuration

### Approval Workflow Configuration

You can configure different approval requirements for different workflow types. This allows the same multi-agent framework to support both human-in-the-loop and fully automated workflows.

#### Video Script Creation (Approval Required)
```python
workflow_config = {
    "requires_approval_after": ["ScriptWriter"],  # User must approve script
    "auto_proceed_agents": [],
    "workflow_sequence": ["ScriptWriter", "AudioSelector"]
}
```

#### Blog Writing (Fully Automated)
```python
workflow_config = {
    "requires_approval_after": [],  # No approval needed
    "auto_proceed_agents": ["ContentWriter", "SEOOptimizer"],
    "workflow_sequence": ["ContentWriter", "SEOOptimizer"]
}
```

#### Code Review (Partial Approval)
```python
workflow_config = {
    "requires_approval_after": ["SecurityAnalyzer"],  # Only security needs approval
    "auto_proceed_agents": ["CodeAnalyzer"],
    "workflow_sequence": ["CodeAnalyzer", "SecurityAnalyzer", "PerformanceAnalyzer"]
}
```

#### Configuration Options
- **`requires_approval_after`**: List of agent names that require user approval after their work
- **`auto_proceed_agents`**: List of agent names that can automatically proceed to invoke next agents
- **`workflow_sequence`**: Optional list defining the typical order of agent involvement

- **Context Preservation**: Shared conversation context across agents

### State Management
- **Workflow Phases**: Tracks current state (initial, script_creation, awaiting_approval, etc.)
- **Conversation History**: Complete record of all interactions
- **Serializable State**: JSON-based persistence for pause/resume

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback responses when agents fail
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and recovery suggestions
- **Session Recovery**: Automatic session restart on resume

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import Errors**:
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Check Python version compatibility (3.8+)

2. **API Key Issues**:
   - Verify API keys in `api_keys_config.env`
   - Check API key permissions and quotas
   - **Try the demo first**: `python demo.py` works without API keys

3. **Conversation Loading Errors**:
   - Check `saved_conversations/` directory permissions
   - Verify JSON file integrity

### Getting Help
- **Start with the demo**: `python demo.py` to understand the workflow
- Check the conversation summary for debugging context
- Review error messages in the console output
- Ensure API endpoints are accessible

## üêõ Recent Bug Fixes

### Clean Architecture Refactoring (v1.2)
**Issue**: `main.py` contained hardcoded video script-specific logic, making it impossible to reuse for other workflow types.

**Problems**:
- Hardcoded workflow configuration (agent roles, approval rules)
- Hardcoded UI text ("video script creation")
- Hardcoded completion detection logic (AudioSelector-specific)
- Hardcoded agent color mapping

**Solution**:
- Moved all task-specific logic to `ScriptGroupChatManager`
- Made `main.py` completely generic (`MultiAgentCLI`)
- Added workflow methods: `get_workflow_display_info()`, `get_agent_colors()`, `is_workflow_complete()`
- Created clean separation between infrastructure and business logic

**Result**: `main.py` now works with any workflow type. Creating new workflows (blog writing, code review, etc.) requires only a new workflow manager class.

### Conversation Isolation Fix (v1.1)
**Issue**: Saved conversation files contained chat history from multiple different conversations mixed together.

**Root Cause**: 
1. Workflow state was not being reset between new conversations, causing history accumulation
2. Double-nesting in serialization created `workflow_state.workflow_state.conversation_history` structure

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `reset_workflow_state()` method to clear conversation history when starting new conversations
- Simplified serialization structure to prevent double-nesting
- Updated resume logic to handle the cleaner data structure

**Result**: Each conversation now maintains completely isolated history, and saved files have a clean structure.
