**6. AudioSelector:**
Based on the approved script titled **"The Graceful Hunter: Exploring the Cheetah,"** I will provide audio recommendations that enhance the visual and narrative aspects of the project. Here are my detailed audio selections:

### 1. Background Music Selection
**Genre and Style:** 
- **African Tribal Fusion** – This genre combines traditional African rhythms with modern elements, which will complement the theme of the cheetah and its habitat.
  
**Specific Recommendations:** 
- **"African Sunrise" by AShamaluevMusic** - A captivating track with authentic African beats, perfect for evoking the essence of the savannah.
- **"Savanna" by Bensound** - An upbeat and inspiring track that captures the energy and grace of a cheetah in motion.

**Tempo and Energy Levels:** 
- Look for music with a moderate tempo, around 120 BPM, to maintain an engaging flow without overpowering dialogue.

### 2. Sound Effects Recommendations  
- **Cheetah Sounds:** Use actual cheetah calls or growls to reinforce the presence of the animal when discussing its traits.
- **Nature Ambiance:** Include sounds like rustling grass, distant birdsong, or wind to create an immersive atmosphere, especially during scenic transitions or when depicting the cheetah in its habitat.

### 3. Audio Timing and Mixing Suggestions
- **Fade In/Out:** Start with a gentle fade in of background music at the beginning of the video to set the mood; consider fading it out gradually as narration or dialogue starts.
- **Volume Levels:** Ensure background music remains at a lower volume (about 15-20% lower than the voiceover) to support, rather than overshadow, the narration or dialogue.

### 4. Licensing and Source Information
- **Tracks should be sourced from**:
    - **Epidemic Sound** for a vast selection of royalty-free music, specifically searching for "African" and "nature" tags.
    - **YouTube Audio Library** for free options under the category of "World" or "Acoustic."
    
### 5. Alternative Options
If the above suggestions do not meet your vision:
- Explore tracks from **Artlist** or **Pond5**, which offer a variety of high-quality, royalty-free music options. Look for themes around “wildlife” or “nature” for additional inspiring choices.

These audio selections should effectively enhance the storytelling in your video about the cheetah while aligning with the script's themes and objectives. If you need any adjustments or additional options, please let me know!
