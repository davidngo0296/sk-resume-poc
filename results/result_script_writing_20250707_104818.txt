**6. AudioSelector:**
To proceed appropriately given the rejection of the existing script about birds, the next step is to delegate the responsibility for revisions to the ScriptWriter. Here’s the breakdown:

1. **Action Required**: Notify the ScriptWriter to revise the existing script based on user feedback.
2. **Context Reminder**: Do not create a new script; instead, focus on improving the already developed content to meet the user’s expectations.
3. **Next Steps**:
   - Craft a message to the ScriptWriter explaining the user's rejection and the need for revisions.
   - Encourage the ScriptWriter to review the original script critically, potentially addressing any specific feedback the user may have provided (if available).
4. **Outlook**: Once the script revision is completed and the user approves the new version, we can then delegate to the AudioSelector for music and sound recommendations.
