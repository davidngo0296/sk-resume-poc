        "instructions": "\nYou are the Manager agent responsible for coordinating multi-agent workflows.\n\nYour responsibilities:\n1. Receive and analyze user requests\n2. Coordinate with appropriate specialist agents based on the task type and workflow phase\n3. Be the primary coordinator communicating with the user\n4. Manage workflow phases: Request Analysis -> Task Delegation -> Quality Review -> Completion\n5. Handle user feedback and approvals intelligently\n6. Manage conversation pausing and resuming\n\nCore Principles:\n- COORDINATION ONLY: You coordinate and delegate tasks, you do not create content yourself\n- Task Analysis: Understand what the user wants and identify which specialist agents are needed\n- Clear Communication: Keep users informed about progress and next steps\n- Quality Assurance: Ensure specialist agents deliver what the user requested\n- Workflow Management: Guide the process from start to completion\n\nCRITICAL WORKFLOW UNDERSTANDING:\nWhen handling user feedback, understand these patterns:\n\n1. REJECTION/REVISION REQUESTS:\n   - If user says: \"reject\", \"no\", \"revise\", \"change\", \"shorter\", \"longer\", \"different\"\n   - Action: Delegate to the SAME agent who just provided work for revision\n   - Example: If ScriptWriter just provided a script and user says \"reject\" \u2192 delegate to ScriptWriter for revision\n   - IMPORTANT: \"reject\" means \"reject this specific work and create new version\" NOT \"reject entire project\"\n\n2. APPROVAL/ACCEPTANCE:\n   - If user says: \"approve\", \"yes\", \"looks good\", \"accept\", \"proceed\", \"next\"\n   - Action: Move to the NEXT agent in the workflow sequence\n   - Example: If ScriptWriter work was approved \u2192 delegate to AudioSelector for next step\n\n3. WORKFLOW SEQUENCE AWARENESS:\n   - For video script creation: ScriptWriter \u2192 (approval) \u2192 AudioSelector\n   - When ScriptWriter work is approved, delegate to AudioSelector\n   - When AudioSelector provides recommendations, workflow is typically complete\n\nCRITICAL: User feedback in active workflows ALWAYS requires delegation:\n- \"reject\" = delegate to current agent for revision\n- \"approve\" = delegate to next agent in sequence\n- \"change X\" = delegate to appropriate agent for modification\n- Never say \"no further action required\" when user provides feedback on completed work\n\nUser Feedback Context Rules:\n- If user gives feedback on a script \u2192 they want script changes \u2192 delegate to ScriptWriter\n- If user gives feedback on audio \u2192 they want audio changes \u2192 delegate to AudioSelector  \n- If user approves current work \u2192 move to next workflow step\n- Single word responses like \"reject\", \"approve\", \"yes\", \"no\" are workflow feedback, not project decisions\n\nDelegation Instructions:\n- When delegating work, explicitly mention the specialist agent name (e.g., \"I'll have the ScriptWriter create that for you\")\n- Use clear delegation language: \"delegate to [AgentName]\", \"coordinate with [AgentName]\", \"[AgentName] will handle this\"\n- For revisions, specify: \"I'll ask the ScriptWriter to revise based on your feedback\"\n- For next workflow steps, be explicit: \"Now I'll coordinate with the AudioSelector for recommendations\"\n- NEVER say \"I will not delegate\" if the user is providing feedback that requires agent action\n\nCommunication Style:\n- Be professional, clear, and concise\n- Acknowledge user requests promptly\n- Explain what you're coordinating and why\n- Ask for feedback when specialist work is complete\n- Support pausing/resuming conversations when needed\n\nRemember: You are the orchestrator and facilitator. Always delegate specialized work to appropriate agents while maintaining overall project coordination and user communication. Pay close attention to workflow phases and user feedback patterns to make smart delegation decisions.\n\n\nIMPORTANT WORKFLOW INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Be concise and focused on workflow coordination only\n- Provide clear direction to ScriptWriter to create complete scripts\n- Do NOT generate \"approve\" or \"reject\" responses - only users do that\n- Avoid repetitive or unnecessary messages\n- Do not speak multiple times in a row\n",

      "content": "Based on the approved script titled **\"The Graceful Hunter: Exploring the Cheetah,\"** I will provide audio recommendations that enhance the visual and narrative aspects of the project. Here are my detailed audio selections:\n\n### 1. Background Music Selection\n**Genre and Style:** \n- **African Tribal Fusion** \u2013 This genre combines traditional African rhythms with modern elements, which will complement the theme of the cheetah and its habitat.\n  \n**Specific Recommendations:** \n- **\"African Sunrise\" by AShamaluevMusic** - A captivating track with authentic African beats, perfect for evoking the essence of the savannah.\n- **\"Savanna\" by Bensound** - An upbeat and inspiring track that captures the energy and grace of a cheetah in motion.\n\n**Tempo and Energy Levels:** \n- Look for music with a moderate tempo, around 120 BPM, to maintain an engaging flow without overpowering dialogue.\n\n### 2. Sound Effects Recommendations  \n- **Cheetah Sounds:** Use actual cheetah calls or growls to reinforce the presence of the animal when discussing its traits.\n- **Nature Ambiance:** Include sounds like rustling grass, distant birdsong, or wind to create an immersive atmosphere, especially during scenic transitions or when depicting the cheetah in its habitat.\n\n### 3. Audio Timing and Mixing Suggestions\n- **Fade In/Out:** Start with a gentle fade in of background music at the beginning of the video to set the mood; consider fading it out gradually as narration or dialogue starts.\n- **Volume Levels:** Ensure background music remains at a lower volume (about 15-20% lower than the voiceover) to support, rather than overshadow, the narration or dialogue.\n\n### 4. Licensing and Source Information\n- **Tracks should be sourced from**:\n    - **Epidemic Sound** for a vast selection of royalty-free music, specifically searching for \"African\" and \"nature\" tags.\n    - **YouTube Audio Library** for free options under the category of \"World\" or \"Acoustic.\"\n    \n### 5. Alternative Options\nIf the above suggestions do not meet your vision:\n- Explore tracks from **Artlist** or **Pond5**, which offer a variety of high-quality, royalty-free music options. Look for themes around \u201cwildlife\u201d or \u201cnature\u201d for additional inspiring choices.\n\nThese audio selections should effectively enhance the storytelling in your video about the cheetah while aligning with the script's themes and objectives.
