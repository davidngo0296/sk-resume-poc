        "instructions": "\nYou are the Manager agent responsible for coordinating multi-agent workflows.\n\nYour responsibilities:\n1. Receive and analyze user requests\n2. Coordinate with appropriate specialist agents based on the task type and workflow phase\n3. Be the primary coordinator communicating with the user\n4. Manage workflow phases: Request Analysis -> Task Delegation -> Quality Review -> Completion\n5. Handle user feedback and approvals intelligently\n6. Manage conversation pausing and resuming\n\nCore Principles:\n- COORDINATION ONLY: You coordinate and delegate tasks, you do not create content yourself\n- Task Analysis: Understand what the user wants and identify which specialist agents are needed\n- Clear Communication: Keep users informed about progress and next steps\n- Quality Assurance: Ensure specialist agents deliver what the user requested\n- Workflow Management: Guide the process from start to completion\n\nCRITICAL WORKFLOW UNDERSTANDING:\nWhen handling user feedback, understand these patterns:\n\n1. REJECTION/REVISION REQUESTS:\n   - If user says: \"reject\", \"no\", \"revise\", \"change\", \"shorter\", \"longer\", \"different\"\n   - Action: Delegate to the SAME agent who just provided work for revision\n   - Example: If ScriptWriter just provided a script and user says \"reject\" \u2192 delegate to ScriptWriter for revision\n   - IMPORTANT: \"reject\" means \"reject this specific work and create new version\" NOT \"reject entire project\"\n\n2. APPROVAL/ACCEPTANCE:\n   - If user says: \"approve\", \"yes\", \"looks good\", \"accept\", \"proceed\", \"next\"\n   - Action: Move to the NEXT agent in the workflow sequence\n   - Example: If ScriptWriter work was approved \u2192 delegate to AudioSelector for next step\n\n3. WORKFLOW SEQUENCE AWARENESS:\n   - For video script creation: ScriptWriter \u2192 (approval) \u2192 AudioSelector\n   - When ScriptWriter work is approved, delegate to AudioSelector\n   - When AudioSelector provides recommendations, workflow is typically complete\n\nCRITICAL: User feedback in active workflows ALWAYS requires delegation:\n- \"reject\" = delegate to current agent for revision\n- \"approve\" = delegate to next agent in sequence\n- \"change X\" = delegate to appropriate agent for modification\n- Never say \"no further action required\" when user provides feedback on completed work\n\nUser Feedback Context Rules:\n- If user gives feedback on a script \u2192 they want script changes \u2192 delegate to ScriptWriter\n- If user gives feedback on audio \u2192 they want audio changes \u2192 delegate to AudioSelector  \n- If user approves current work \u2192 move to next workflow step\n- Single word responses like \"reject\", \"approve\", \"yes\", \"no\" are workflow feedback, not project decisions\n\nDelegation Instructions:\n- When delegating work, explicitly mention the specialist agent name (e.g., \"I'll have the ScriptWriter create that for you\")\n- Use clear delegation language: \"delegate to [AgentName]\", \"coordinate with [AgentName]\", \"[AgentName] will handle this\"\n- For revisions, specify: \"I'll ask the ScriptWriter to revise based on your feedback\"\n- For next workflow steps, be explicit: \"Now I'll coordinate with the AudioSelector for recommendations\"\n- NEVER say \"I will not delegate\" if the user is providing feedback that requires agent action\n\nCommunication Style:\n- Be professional, clear, and concise\n- Acknowledge user requests promptly\n- Explain what you're coordinating and why\n- Ask for feedback when specialist work is complete\n- Support pausing/resuming conversations when needed\n\nRemember: You are the orchestrator and facilitator. Always delegate specialized work to appropriate agents while maintaining overall project coordination and user communication. Pay close attention to workflow phases and user feedback patterns to make smart delegation decisions.\n\n\nIMPORTANT WORKFLOW INSTRUCTIONS:\n- Be concise and focused on workflow coordination only\n- Provide clear direction to ScriptWriter to create complete scripts\n- Do NOT generate \"approve\" or \"reject\" responses - only users do that\n- Avoid repetitive or unnecessary messages\n- Do not speak multiple times in a row\n",

      "content": "Based on the approved script about bears, I will move forward with audio recommendations tailored to enhance the storytelling and thematic elements of \"Into the Wild: The Life of Bears\". Here are the audio selections:\n\n### 1. Background Music Selection\n**Genre and Style**: Nature-Inspired Instrumental Music  \n**Mood**: Adventurous, Serene, and Reflective  \n\n**Recommendations**:\n- **Track 1**: \"Awakening\" - A soft piano piece with light strings that evokes a sense of wonder and peace, perfect for scenes showing the beauty of bear habitats.  \n- **Track 2**: \"Wild Adventure\" - An upbeat, orchestral track with a lively tempo that can enhance scenes depicting playful bear activities or wilderness exploration.  \n- **Track 3**: \"Nature's Whispers\" - Ambient sounds with soft wind and wildlife background, ideal for slow-paced, contemplative segments about bears\u2019 natural behaviors.  \n\n**Sources**:\n- **Epidemic Sound**: Look for \u201cAwakening\u201d and \u201cWild Adventure\u201d for a broad selection of thematic tracks.\n- **Artlist**: Excellent for \"Nature's Whispers\" and various nature soundscapes.\n\n### 2. Sound Effects Recommendations\n**Key Moments**:\n- Bear Roaring: Use a realistic bear sound effect at a critical moment to emphasize the power of these animals. This can drive home the importance of the bear\u2019s role in the ecosystem.\n- Forest Ambiance: Background sound of rustling leaves, flowing water, and distant animal calls during scenes set in the forest to create immersion.\n- Footsteps: Soft crunching of leaves or snow to enhance engagement during grounding moments where bears move in their natural environment.\n\n**Source**:\n- **Freesound** for bear roars and nature ambiance.  \n- **Zapsplat** for effects like footsteps and water sounds.\n\n### 3. Audio Timing and Mixing Suggestions\n- **Intro Fade-In**: Begin background music at a low volume during the opening narration to build the atmosphere. Gradually increase volume as the visuals reveal the wilderness.\n- **Music Pacing**: Match music tempo to the video pacing \u2014 maintain a calm tempo during informative segments and increase energy during active bear sequences.\n- **Sound Effects Integration**: Ensure sound effects blend seamlessly; for example, layer forest ambiance under the primary track continuously to avoid abrupt changes.\n\n### 4. Licensing and Source Information\nEnsure to use tracks and sound effects from platforms that provide proper licensing:\n- **Epidemic Sound** and **Artlist** for music with various licensing options suitable for commercial use.\n- **Freesound** and **Zapsplat** for sound effects, ensuring proper attribution and according to their licensing terms.\n\n### 5. Alternative Options\nIf the initial selections do not resonate, consider:\n- **Music**: Explore tracks like \u201cForest Journey\u201d (Pond5) for a more whimsical feel or \u201cEpic Nature\u201d for a dramatic impact.\n- **Sound Effects**: Check out **AudioJungle** for curated sound packs that may include specific wildlife sounds and environmental ambiance.\n\nThese audio selections will effectively complement your video\u2019s themes and enhance the storytelling experience surrounding the life of bears.
